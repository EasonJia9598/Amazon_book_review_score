# Amazon Book Review Score Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict Amazon book review scores based on customer review texts. By utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the project explores text-based feature engineering and machine learning methods to enhance predictive accuracy. This project focuses on predicting Amazon book review scores based on customers’ review texts.
It uses several classic NLP methods to create TF-IDF word embeddings, and we apply a Random Forest model to train on the processed dataset.
The project also explores various feature engineering techniques, and we analyze the model’s performance based on different part-of-speech tagging and data filtering outcomes.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning review texts, removing stopwords, and normalizing text data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting insights from text using **TF-IDF** and **part-of-speech (POS) tagging**.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Training a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict review scores.
- **Evaluation & Optimization**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **PyTorch** (for potential deep learning models)

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning in predicting book review scores. By improving text preprocessing and feature selection, the model achieves better predictive accuracy.
