This project will focus on how to predict Amazon book reviewing scores based on customers' reviewing texts. 
It used a few classic NLP methods to create TF-IDF word embeddings and we use Random Forest to train on our processed dataset. 
It also involves a few ways of feature engineering. And we discuss the model performance with different part-to-speech tagging
and purging outcomes.
